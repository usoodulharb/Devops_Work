1: open a terminal, type `sudo visudo`.

visudo is a txt document which handle configurations for sudo prompt. We’ll set our account from in NOPASSWD setting.

2: go to the end of the file, then add the following line in this format:

[username] ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

Remember, [username] will be replaced by your local account’s name. So, if your name is David, it will be David ALL = (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL.
