Problem
you cannot log in to your docker registry. The error return is: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority.


For linux Users:

Resolving the problem:

Create the following directory on the server where you are running docker login.

--> mkdir -p /etc/docker/certs.d/privateregistry:5555

Copy your docker registry certificate file from your docker registry host to the cluster where you are running docker login.
 Rename your docker registry certificate file to /etc/docker/certs.d/<your_registry_host_name>:<your_registry_host_port>/ca.crt.

--> scp <your_registry_host_name>:/opt/registry/certs/domain.crt /etc/docker/certs.d/<your_registry_host_name>:<your_registry_host_port>/ca.crt


For example:

mkdir -p /etc/docker/certs.d/
scp privateregistry:/opt/registry/certs/domain.crt /etc/docker/certs.d/privateregistry:5555/ca.crt
